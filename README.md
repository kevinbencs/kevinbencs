## Hi there 

- I'm Kevin, a Junior Full-Stack Developer.
- I build modern web applications using JavaScript-based technologies.
- My main focus is on React / Next.js on the frontend and Node.js on the backend.

I enjoy working on real-world projects involving REST APIs, databases, authentication, and containerized environments.

# 🔧 Tech stack:
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- React / Next.js
- Node.js / Express
- SQL / Prisma
- MondoDB
- Docker

# 📌 Featured project:

URL Shortener - Node.js (Express), Docker, Traefik, React
- A full-stack URL shortener built with a distributed architecture.
- The application includes an authenticated dashboard where users can create, edit, and delete short links, while redirects are handled by a separate lightweight service optimized for performance.
- The system is split across multiple services (a frontend and API running on Oracle Cloud, and a dedicated redirect service deployed on Vercel)

News Portal - Next.js, TailwindCSS, Supabase
- A content-driven web application with a public news interface and an admin dashboard.
- Admins can create, edit, delete, and publish articles, manage content, and send email notifications.
- The application includes authentication, role-based access, and database-backed content management.
